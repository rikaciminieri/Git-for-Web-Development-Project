        It doesn't exist in the normal document layout flow, it sits on its own layer separate frome verything else
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
        display: inline-block allows you to give elemnt a width but doesn't take up all of the horizontal space
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
        Display block by default: 
            <h1>

            <section>
        Display inline
            <span>

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
        The box model is a box that wraps around every element in HTML. The content is wrapped by padding, which is wrapped by a border, which is wrapped by a margin
        You can manipulate how thick or thin these boxes can be to achieve different looks. When you set the width and height properties of an element with CSS, you just set the width and height of the content area. 
        To calculate the full size of an element, you must also add padding, borders and margins.
